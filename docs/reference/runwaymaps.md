# Runway Maps
At designated aerodromes, OzStrips will automatically toggle runway crossing and release maps, dependant on the contents of bars within the runway bay.

When pressing the relevant button within the control bar, or using the keyboard shortcut, a menu will open up, and allow the desired runway to be displayed within the bar to be selected.

OzStrips effectively takes control of these runway crossing maps, and will detoggle them if these maps are manually toggled on, without the corresponding bar. If this is not desired, there exists an option within the View menu to inhibit this.
