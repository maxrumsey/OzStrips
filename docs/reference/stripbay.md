## Buttons
### Add to Queue Button
Pick a strip, and press "Start Queue" to add a queue bar if it is not present, and place the strip below the bar. The number of aircraft below the bar ("queued up") will be displayed in parentheses.
### Toggle Queue Bar Button
This button toggles the presence of the queue bar.

## Moving Strips 
### Vertically
To move strips vertically, pick a strip, (left click on the Callsign), and press your arrow keys.
### Between Bays
To move a strip between bays, you can either ["SID trigger" the strip](strips.md), or pick the strip and drop it into another bay by left clicking on the dark background of the strip.

It is recommended to move strips using the SID trigger, rather than picking and dropping, as this can lead to strips going into bays they really shouldn't be going into if you misclick.

### Ctrl-click
By clicking a strip and control-clicking on another strip or bar, within the same or different bay, you can move the strip above or below the other bay item.
