## Strip Colours
Departure strips are blue, while arrival strips are yellow.

## Strip Posting
You will only see strips for aircraft that have requested planned an ADES or ADEP of your aerodrome. Aircraft doing circuit work at your aerodrome, but not arriving or departing there will not have a strip.

## Alerts
### Non-standard Cruising Altitude
Indicates a pilot had filed a level that is non-compliant with the table of standard cruising levels per the Australian AIP.
### Non-compliant Route Filed
Indicates a pilot has filed a route that is contrary to the list of routes in the Australian ERSA Flight Planning Requirements document.

It is at the controller's discretion whether or not the aircraft is recleared along a new route. Take into account possible workload and loss of strategic separation due to the non-compliant route, effect on TCU operations and ability of the pilot to reenter a new route.
