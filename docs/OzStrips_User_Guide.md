## üéØ What is OzStrips?

OzStrips is a plugin for vatSys that replaces paper flight strips with digital ones. Think of it as a digital version of the paper strips that air traffic controllers use to track aircraft.

**Why use OzStrips?**
- No more paper strips cluttering your desk
- Automatic updates when aircraft move between positions
- Visual alerts for potential issues
- Integration with vatSys for seamless operation

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install and Connect
1. **Install**: OzStrips comes with VATPAC's vatSys profiles, or download using the [vatSys Plugin Manager](https://github.com/badvectors/PluginManager)
2. **Open**: Go to **Window** ‚Üí **OzStrips** in vatSys
3. **Connect**: Select your airport from the dropdown
4. **Verify**: Connection status should turn green

![OzStrips Dropdown](images/ozstripsdropdown.png)

*Finding OzStrips in the vatSys menu*

### Step 2: Your First Strip
When an aircraft files a flight plan to/from your airport, a strip will appear automatically.

**What you'll see:**
- **Blue strips** = Departing aircraft
- **Yellow strips** = Arriving aircraft  
- **Pink strips** = Local aircraft (circuits)

![Strip Example](images/ozstripsexample.png)

*Your first strip - this aircraft is departing (blue)*

### Step 3: Basic Strip Movement
**The easiest way to move strips:**
1. **Click the SID box** (Standard Instrument Departure) on the strip
2. The strip moves to the next bay automatically
3. This is called "SID triggering" and is the recommended method

**Alternative method (pick and drop):**
1. Click the **callsign** to select the strip
2. Click the **destination bay** to drop it there

### Step 4: Understanding Strip Bays
Strips move through different bays representing stages of flight:

| Bay | Meaning | What Happens Here |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| **Preactive** | Aircraft filed plan, not cleared yet | Initial planning |
| **Cleared** | Aircraft has clearance | Ready for pushback |
| **Pushback** | Aircraft requesting/approved pushback | Ground operations |
| **Holding Point** | Aircraft at holding point | Ready for taxi |
| **Runway** | Aircraft on runway | Ready for takeoff |
| **Departures** | Aircraft airborne | Handed off to departures |

## üìö Essential Concepts (Learn These First)

### What is a "Strip"?
A strip is a digital card containing all the information about an aircraft's flight. Each strip has multiple fields you can interact with.

### What is "SID Triggering"?
Clicking the SID (Standard Instrument Departure) box automatically moves the strip to the next bay. This is the safest and most efficient way to move strips.

### What are "Bays"?
Bays are sections of your stripboard that represent different stages of an aircraft's flight. Strips move from left to right as the aircraft progresses.

### What do the colors mean?
- **Blue**: Departure aircraft (leaving your airport)
- **Yellow**: Arrival aircraft (coming to your airport)
- **Pink**: Local aircraft (staying in your area, like training flights)

---

## üéÆ Your First 10 Minutes

### Try This: Move a Strip
1. Find a strip in the "Preactive" bay
2. Click the **SID box** (the field that shows the departure procedure)
3. Watch the strip move to the "Cleared" bay
4. Click the SID box again to move it to "Pushback"

### Try This: Check for Issues
Look for these visual indicators on strips:
- **Orange background**: Potential problems (hover for details)
- **Yellow border**: Warnings that need attention
- **Red highlights**: Critical issues

### Try This: Use Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Enter**: SID trigger (move to next bay) - *Most important!*
- **Tab**: Mark aircraft as ready
- **F**: Switch between Arrival/Departure/Local
- **X**: Mark as crossing runway

---

## üîß Common Tasks (How to Do What You Need)

### Moving Strips Between Positions
**Recommended method (SID triggering):**
1. Click the **SID box** on the strip
2. Strip moves to next bay automatically
3. Repeat as needed

**Manual method (pick and drop):**
1. Click the **callsign** to select the strip
2. Click the **destination bay** to drop it
3. Use this only when SID triggering isn't appropriate

### Marking Aircraft as Ready
- **Click the "Ready" field** on the strip, OR
- **Press Tab** while the strip is selected

### Changing Aircraft Type
- **Click the aircraft type field** to open flight plan
- **Right-click** for additional options

### Assigning Runways
- **Click the runway field** to change runway assignment
- Available runways depend on your airport

### Handling Arrivals vs Departures
- **Press F** to switch strip type if needed
- **Blue strips** = Departures (leaving)
- **Yellow strips** = Arrivals (coming in)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues (And How to Fix Them)

### "Aircraft not appearing in OzStrips"
**Solution:**
1. Click the aircraft in vatSys
2. Press **FOR STP** 
3. Check that the aircraft is going to/from your airport

### "Strip moved to wrong bay"
**Solution:**
1. Use **SID triggering** instead of drag-and-drop
2. Use **Backspace** to remove the strip
3. Press **FOR STP** to restore it

### "Connection shows red"
**Solution:**
1. Wait 10 seconds for connection to establish
2. Check your internet connection
3. Restart OzStrips if needed

### "Strip type is wrong (arrival showing as departure)"
**Solution:**
1. Select the strip
2. Press **F** to flip-flop the type
3. Check the aircraft's filed route
