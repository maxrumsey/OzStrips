## üîÑ Common Workflows

### Departure Workflow (ACD ‚Üí SMC ‚Üí ADC)

#### ACD (Aerodrome Clearance Delivery)
1. Strip appears in **Preactive** bay
2. Assign **SID** (green box), **Runway**, and **CFL** (cleared flight level)
3. Issue clearance to pilot
4. Click **SID** button to move to **Cleared** bay

#### SMC (Surface Movement Control)
1. Aircraft requests pushback - move to **Pushback** bay
2. Enter **Gate** number in top-left field
3. Aircraft requests taxi - move to **Holding Point** bay
4. Enter holding point in **Holding Point** field
5. If crossing runway, enter "x###" in remarks (e.g., "x16L")

#### ADC (Aerodrome Director)
1. Sequence departures using arrow keys
2. Issue line-up instructions - move to **Runway** bay
3. Record take-off time by clicking timer
4. Hand off to departures - click **SID** to move to **Departures** bay

### Arrival Workflow
1. Strip appears in **Arrival** bay (yellow)
2. Assign runway and approach
3. Monitor aircraft approach
4. Issue landing clearance
5. Record landing time
6. Clear runway

### Working with Multiple Controllers
- **Top-down**: Select "All" view mode
- **Split positions**: Select appropriate view (ACD+SMC, ADC+SMC, etc.)
