# Installation
Use of the [vatSys Plugin Manager](https://github.com/badvectors/PluginManager) is recommended for all users. Installation instructions are available in the project README.

If you have previously **manually** installed a previous version of OzStrips, ensure you delete the plugin files before installing via the Plugin Manager.

If you have a problem installing using the plugin manager, delete the `C:\Program Files (x86)\vatSys\bin\Plugins\OzStrips` folder if you have it.

# Troubleshooting
Have two OzStrips windows, or two "OzStrips" buttons in your Windows dropdown? This means there is an old version of the plugin hanging around. Check your C://Program Files (x86)/vatSys/bin/Plugins directory.
